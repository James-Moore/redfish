### Distributed Management Task Force

https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish

The Distributed Management Task Force has created a server management standard called Redfish. 
DMTF’s Redfish® is a standard designed to deliver simple and secure management for converged, 
hybrid IT and the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). Both human readable and machine capable, 
Redfish leverages common Internet and web services standards to expose information directly to 
the modern tool chain.

The DMTF's Python Library can be found here:
